# Book Library

A new Flutter project.


- performing a local search and filter a list based on a text field.
- For the Book Covers, I am using the images from the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) API.
- Using the [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image/install) library to load and cache network images, with placeholder and error widget.
- Dynamic icon in the search field
